You will be given a text containing information about various items. Your task is to extract specific details for each item and format them according to the given specifications.

Here is the text you will be working with:
<text>
{{TEXT}}
</text>

Your goal is to extract the following information for each item:
- Item_Description
- Item_Code
- Rate
- Quantity
- Excise Rate
- Line Total

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Identify each separate item in the text. Each item should be treated as a distinct line item.

2. For each line item, extract the required information. If any of the required fields are missing, leave them blank but include the field name.

3. Format the extracted information for each line item as follows:
   Item_Description: [value],,Item_Code: [value],,Rate: [value],,Quantity: [value],,Excise Rate: [value],,Line Total: [value],,

4. If there are multiple line items, separate them with a vertical bar (|) character.

5. Ensure that you maintain the exact formatting, including the double commas (,,) between each field and the vertical bar (|) between line items.

Here's an example of how the output should be formatted for a single line item:
Item_Description: Widget A,,Item_Code: W123,,Rate: 50.00,,Quantity: 2,,Excise Rate: 10.00%,,Line Total: 110.00,,

And for multiple line items:
Item_Description: Widget A,,Item_Code: W123,,Rate: 50.00,,Quantity: 2,,Excise Rate: 10.00%,,Line Total: 110.00,,|Item_Description: Gadget B,,Item_Code: G456,,Rate: 75.00,,Quantity: 1,,Excise Rate: 15.00%,,Line Total: 86.25,,

Please provide your answer within <answer> tags.
