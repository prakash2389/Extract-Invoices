You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting key-value pairs from a document text based on given field descriptions. Follow these instructions carefully:

    First, review the field descriptions provided:

    <field_descriptions>
    {key_fields_Description}
    </field_descriptions>

    Now, examine the following document text:

    <document_text>
    {read_output}
    </document_text>

    Your task is to extract key-value pairs from the document text based on the field descriptions provided. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Extract all relevant information for each field listed in the field descriptions.
    2. If a field's value is not found in the document, return "None" for that field.
    3. For all amount-related fields, extract the numeric value without any thousands separators (commas or spaces) or currency symbols.
    4. For rate-related fields, include the percentage sign (%) at the end of the value.
    5. For the Currency field, use the three-letter ISO 4217 currency code.
    6. For the SHIP_TO_PLANT_ZIP_CODE and VENDOR_ZIPCODE fields, extract only the 6-digit code.

    Present your findings in the following format:
    <extracted_data>
    FIELD_NAME: extracted_value
    FIELD_NAME: extracted_value
    ...
    </extracted_data>

    Ensure that you extract information for all of the following entities:

    CURRENCY
    TOTAL_OTHER_CHARGES
    INVOICE_DATE
    MAIN_HSN_CODE
    PO_NUMBER
    INVOICE_NUMBER
    IRN_NUMBER
    BILL_TO_NAME
    SHIP_TO_PLANT_GSTIN
    SHIP_TO_PLANT_ADDRESS
    SHIP_TO_PLANT_NAME
    SHIP_TO_PLANT_ZIP_CODE
    SHIP_TO_PLANT_CITY
    INVOICE_AMOUNT
    TOTAL_CGST_AMOUNT
    TOTAL_IGST_AMOUNT
    TOTAL_SGST_AMOUNT
    TAX_AMOUNT
    GROSS_AMOUNT
    BASIC_AMOUNT
    VENDOR_ADDRESS
    VENDOR_NAME
    VENDOR_PAN_NUMBER
    VENDOR_GSTIN_NUMBER
    VENDOR_ZIPCODE
    VENDOR_CITY
    VENDOR_STATE
    VENDOR_COUNTRY

    Remember to adhere to the guidelines provided, especially regarding boolean values, amount formatting, and currency codes. If you're unsure about a particular extraction, use your best judgment based on the information available in the document text and field descriptions.
